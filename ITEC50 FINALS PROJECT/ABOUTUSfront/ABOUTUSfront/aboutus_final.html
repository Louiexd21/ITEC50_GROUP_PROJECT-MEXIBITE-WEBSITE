                    <p>Mexibite is one of the popular restaurants in the barangay of Inocencio, Trece Martires City.
                        It is known for its delectable, crispy, and various flavors of chicken wings, as well as the
                         fact that it offers unlimited wings and rice. It started first at Trece Martires City Market 
                         in 2019, where it only offers nachos and tacos. Then they came up with the idea of making 
                         unli wings, which became popular and the best-selling food in their cuisines later on. However,
                          as the pandemic became a hindrance to their restaurant, they were forced to go bankrupt due to 
                          strict implementations of health protocols. As the new normal approaches the country, they found a 
                          place here in Brgy. Inocencio, Trece Martires City.
